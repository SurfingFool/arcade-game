#Frogger Arcade Game Clone
A simple game that simulates the old arcade game _Frogger_. Single player attempts to reach the water by crossing a path of 
multiple moving bugs without being hit.

##Install
Download the arcade-game files required to play the game from the following repository to your computer:

https://github.com/SurfingFool/arcade-game.git

Place these files in a folder and directory of your choice.

##Use and Tips
Locate the HTML file within your saved arcade-game folder. Right-click on the HTML file and choose ```Open With``` and click 
on the browser of your choosing.  Game will open in your browser and start automatically.  Use the 'arrow' buttons on your 
keyboard to move your player up, down, left, or right.  The object of the game is to not collide your player with the moving
enemy bugs.  Successfully reaching the water without a collision, results in a win.
