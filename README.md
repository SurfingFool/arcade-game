#Frogger Arcade Game Clone
A simple game that simulates the old arcade game _Frogger_. A single player attempts to reach the water by crossing a path of 
multiple moving bugs without colliding and being destroyed.

##Install
Installation requires that you download a complete copy of all associated files.  One easy method is to use ```git clone```.  Use the following command line within Git to grab a complete copy as follows from the existing repository:

```git clone https://github.com/SurfingFool/arcade-game.git```

Place these files in a folder and directory of your choice.

##Use and Tips
Locate the HTML file within your saved arcade-game folder. In Windows, right-click on the HTML 'index' file and scroll down to ```Open with```.  Left-click on your preferred browser.  Game will open in your browser and start automatically.  Use the 'arrow' buttons on your
keyboard to move your player up, down, left, or right.  The object of the game is to not collide your player with the moving
enemy bugs.  Successfully reaching the water without a collision, results in a win.
